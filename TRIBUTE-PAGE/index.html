          Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam
        </h1>
        <p class="text-justify max-md:text-sm lg:text-xl">
          <b> Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </b> BR (15 October 1931 - 27 July
          2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as
          the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and raised in a
          Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and
          aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist
          and science administrator, mainly at the
          <b>Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)</b> and
          <b> Space Research Organisation (ISRO)</b> and was intimately involved
          in India's civilian space programme and military missile development
          efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his
          work on the development of <b> ballistic missile</b> and
          <b>launch vehicle technology</b>. He also played a pivotal
          organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II
          nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by
          India in 1974. Kalam was elected as the
          <b>11th president of India in 2002 </b>with the support of both the
          ruling <b>Bharatiya Janata Party</b> and the
          <b>then-opposition Indian National Congress.</b> Widely referred to as
          the <b>"People's President"</b>, he returned to his civilian life of
          education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a
          recipient of several prestigious awards, including the
          <b>Bharat Ratna,</b> (India's highest civilian honour). While
          delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong,
          Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July
          2015, aged 83. Thousands, including national-level dignitaries,
          attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram,
          where he was buried with full state honours.
