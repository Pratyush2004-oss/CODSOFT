            <b> Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </b> BR (15 October 1931 - 27
            July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who
            served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and
            raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied
            physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as
            a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the
            <b>Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)</b> and
            <b> Space Research Organisation (ISRO)</b> and was intimately
            involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile
            development efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of
            India for his work on the development of
            <b> ballistic missile</b> and <b>launch vehicle technology</b>. He
            also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role
            in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the
            original nuclear test by India in 1974. Kalam was elected as the
            <b>11th president of India in 2002 </b>with the support of both the
            ruling <b>Bharatiya Janata Party</b> and the
            <b>then-opposition Indian National Congress.</b> Widely referred to
            as the <b>"People's President"</b>, he returned to his civilian life
            of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was
            a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the
            <b>Bharat Ratna,</b> (India's highest civilian honour). While
            delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong,
            Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July
            2015, aged 83. Thousands, including national-level dignitaries,
            attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram,
            where he was buried with full state honours.

            Early Life and Education
          </h1>
          <p class="text-sm text-justify lg:text-lg">
            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on
            <b> 15 October 1931</b>, to a <b>Tamil Muslim family</b> in the
            pilgrimage centre of <b>Rameswaram on Pamban Island</b>, then in the
            Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father
            <b>Marakayar</b> was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his
            mother Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned a ferry that took
            Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now
            uninhabited <b>Dhanushkodi</b>. Kalam was the youngest of four
            brothers and one sister in his family. His ancestors had been
            wealthy <b>Marakayar</b> traders and landowners, with numerous
            properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic
            group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent
            from Arab traders and local women. The family business had involved
            trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and
            from <b>Sri Lanka</b>, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the
            mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the <b>Pamban Bridge</b> to
            the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family
            fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the
            ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam
            was born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the
            family's meager income. In his school years, Kalam had average
            grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had
            a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially
            <b>Mathematics</b>. After completing his education at
            <b>Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram</b>, Kalam went
            on to attend the <b>St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli</b> from
            where he graduated in Physics in 1954. Kalam moved to Madras in 1955
            to study
            <b>Aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology</b>.
            While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was
            dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his
            scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three
            days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to
            him,<b
              >"I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a
              difficult deadline."</b
            >
            He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot,
            as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were
            available in the IAF.
